# YouTube-Homepage Clone

This is a clone of YouTube Homepage that I made using only CSS and HTML.
To run the website, just download the files and open "index.html" using any browser. This is the only the front page and functionality still lacks. 
This project taught me a lot about advanced topics in CSS.
